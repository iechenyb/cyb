level使用参考：http://blog.csdn.net/u012132482/article/details/53501789
1 将区间进行完整补充
WITH TB AS
     (SELECT 'U101' USER_ID, DATE'2016-11-02' START_DT, DATE'2016-11-06' END_DT  FROM DUAL
      UNION ALL
      SELECT 'U102' , DATE'2015-06-01', DATE'2015-06-03' FROM DUAL
      )
    SELECT TB.USER_ID, TB.START_DT + LEVEL - 1
    FROM TB
    CONNECT BY TB.USER_ID = PRIOR TB.USER_ID
           AND LEVEL <= (TB.END_DT - TB.START_DT + 1)
           AND PRIOR DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE IS NOT NULL;		   
2 直接执行看效果
WITH TB AS
 (SELECT 'U101' USER_ID, '12345' MOBILE, 3 CNT  FROM DUAL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'U102' , '33563', 4 FROM DUAL
 )
SELECT A.USER_ID,A.MOBILE,B.LV
    FROM TB A
    LEFT JOIN (
                    SELECT TB.USER_ID, LEVEL LV
                    FROM TB
                    CONNECT BY TB.USER_ID = PRIOR TB.USER_ID
                                 AND LEVEL <= CNT
                                 AND PRIOR DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE IS NOT NULL
                        ) B
        ON A.USER_ID = B.USER_ID
3 生成随机数
SELECT DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE
  FROM DUAL 
  CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 100;
生成日期
SELECT SYSDATE - LEVEL
  FROM DUAL 
  CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 10
生成10个数
SELECT LEVEL
  FROM DUAL 
  CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 10	
4 
    WITH TB AS (
      SELECT 'U1' USER_ID, '哈喽,世界' STR FROM DUAL
        UNION ALL
        SELECT 'U2', '你好啊,地球' FROM DUAL
    )
    SELECT TB.USER_ID, 
           SUBSTR(STR,LEVEL,1)
      FROM TB
    CONNECT BY TB.USER_ID = PRIOR TB.USER_ID
             AND LEVEL <= LENGTH(STR)
             AND PRIOR DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE IS NOT NULL;  
5 列转行
WITH tb AS
 (SELECT 'a' rn,         '1,2,3' i_name    FROM dual
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'b',         '4,5,6'    FROM dual)
  SELECT rn,
       regexp_substr(i_name, '[^,]+', 1, LEVEL)
  FROM tb
CONNECT BY PRIOR dbms_random.value IS NOT NULL
       AND PRIOR rn = rn
       AND LEVEL <= length(i_name) - length(REPLACE(i_name, ',', '')) + 1;
